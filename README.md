### **Stage 4: Finalizing & Ticket Closure**

- Users can respond via email, and replies are logged in the ticket.

## More Practice  
As an **End User**, create a new ticket:  
- **Issue:** *Accounting department needs Adobe upgrade, broken.*  
- As **Help Desk Agent (John)**: Observe the ticketâ€™s properties and update:  
  - Priority: Sev-B (4 hours, 24/7)  
  - Department: Support    
- Work the ticket to completion as **John**.  

As an **End User**, create a third ticket:  
- **Issue:** *CFOâ€™s laptop will no longer turn on.*  
- As **Help Desk Agent (John)**, set properties:  
  - Priority: Sev-B (4 hours, 24/7)  
  - Department: Support  
- Work the ticket to completion as **John**.  

---

## **Real-World Ticket Intake**  
- Tickets can be submitted in various ways:  
  - Phone calls, chat apps, emails, web forms, or in-person requests.  
- In IT support, people often ask for help **without submitting a ticket**.  
- Itâ€™s okay to fix things on the spot, but **always create tickets** for documentation and metrics tracking.  

---

## **Finishing Up & Additional Practice**  
- osTicket offers more features beyond this lab â€“ explore them!  
- Experiment with the email functionality for ticket updates.  
- Repeat this lab multiple times until you can complete it from memory.  
- Building Technical Intuition:  
  - Repetition builds confidence.  
  - Understanding ticket management is crucial for IT help desk roles.

### **Stage 4: Finalizing & Ticket Closure**  
- Solve all remaining tickets.  
- Explain that most ticketing systems (including osTicket) **send email notifications** to users when updates are made.  
- Users can respond via email, and replies are logged in the ticket.

## More Practice  
As an **End User**, create a new ticket:  
- **Issue:** *Accounting department needs Adobe upgrade, broken.*  
- As **Help Desk Agent (John)**: Observe the ticketâ€™s properties and update:  
  - Priority: Sev-B (4 hours, 24/7)  
  - Department: Support    
- Work the ticket to completion as **John**.  

As an **End User**, create a third ticket:  
- **Issue:** *CFOâ€™s laptop will no longer turn on.*  
- As **Help Desk Agent (John)**, set properties:  
  - Priority: Sev-B (4 hours, 24/7)  
  - Department: Support  
- Work the ticket to completion as **John**.  

### **Permission Restrictions**  
- Set **Sev-A** priority for the **SysAdmins Department** on a ticket.  
- Observe that **John** can no longer access the ticket.  
- As **Admin**, switch to the **Admin Panel** and assign yourself **View-access** to SysAdmins.  
- Switch back to **Agent Panel** â€“ now observe the **escalated ticket**.  
- Notice that you can **view** the ticket but **no longer make changes**.   

---

## **Real-World Ticket Intake**  
- Tickets can be submitted in various ways:  
  - Phone calls, chat apps, emails, web forms, or in-person requests.  
- In IT support, people often ask for help **without submitting a ticket**.  
- Itâ€™s okay to fix things on the spot, but **always create tickets** for documentation and metrics tracking.  

---

## **Finishing Up & Additional Practice**  
- osTicket offers more features beyond this lab â€“ explore them!  
- Experiment with the email functionality for ticket updates.  
- Repeat this lab multiple times until you can complete it from memory.  
- Building Technical Intuition:  
  - Repetition builds confidence.  
  - Understanding ticket management is crucial for IT help desk roles.
